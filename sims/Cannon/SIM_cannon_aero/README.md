#SIM\_cannon\_aero

This simulation is described in the Trick Tutorial, Section 8.

It introduces Trick's **collect** mechanism while adding aero-dynamic
forces to the cannon ball (or is it a baseball?) to
simulate throwing a curve ball and a fast ball. Ok, it's a cannon that
shoots curveballs and fast balls. Just go with it.
